System Requirements
-------------------

We recommend using high quality server hardware when running Proxmox Datacenter Manager in
production. While no managed remote or resource depends on Proxmox Datacenter Manager to run, you
might find that Proxmox Datacenter Manager will become a convenient and ciritical tool in your
operations fast enough.
