    button for the PDM instance.

  * dashboard: also show SDN zones if they are in a unknown state.

  * remote wizard: implement support for adding Proxmox Backup Server remotes.

  * pbs remote: rework remote overview to show basic node status and add a
    tree for the datastores. On the right show the usage of the selected
    datastore including RRD metrics and move the snapshot list into a
    dedicated content tab.

  * access control: add support to configure LDAP and AD authentication
    realms.

  * access control: always reload the user list when re-opening the user
    management tab.

  * pve remote: add title label for resources.

  * pve remote: switch to common node info component, which includes slightly
    more information.

  * enable the top navigation bar's documentation button and link it to the
    beta documentation hosted in our wiki.

  * pve storage: do not override timer for updating the status of a storage.

  * pve storage: remove unnecessary 'enabled' status line, we only show
    storages that are enabled anyway.

  * pve resource tree: fix that storages where never filtered out, thus
    crowding the tree and making actual matches of a filter harder to spot.

  * dashboard: allow add PBS remotes via dashboard.

  * pbs snapshot list: add support for loading a specific namespace through a
    namespace selector in the toolbar.

  * pbs snapshot list: add reload button to toolbar.

  * remote wizard: note that login + auto-creation of token currently only
    works for PBS 4. Users still can manually create a API token for their
    older PBS hosts (don't forget to give the token admin permissions).

proxmox-datacenter-manager-ui (0.3.2) trixie; urgency=medium

  * make more strings translatable and implement various i18n related fixes.

  * add storage to the resource tree of Proxmox VE remotes and show basic
    status overview.

  * memory status renderer: use 90% and 97.5% for warning and critical
    thresholds respectively, matching recent changes in Proxmox VE's web UI.

  * dashboard: correctly differentiate the timer and on-click reload events to
    avoid that every periodic update is using the very short max-age value
    that should only get used for force reloads.

  * fix #6782: ui: pve: tree: don't show start/shutdown buttons for templates.

  * dashboard: do not wait until all data sources finished loading, rather
    render each card immediately once the specific requests it depends got
    loaded.

  * dashboard: render last refresh date/time instead of a seconds counter to
    avoid overly frequent UI/DOM updates, reducing the impact to accessibility
    tools like screen readers.

  * main menu: improve load behavior on some edge cases that could result in a
    stale or empty remote list.

  * add initial basic SDN status report to dashboard and add a new SDN Zone
    overview as parent menu entry of the recently added EVPN integration.

  * update to newer widget-toolkit and yew-component crates.

  * pve: add remote tasks-list panel on "Remote" resource tree root entry.

  * sdn overview: add deep-links to remotes datacenter SDN and Zone panels.

  * dashboard: change task summary sorting to prioritize showing the remotes
    with most failed tasks, as high task error counts are normally much more
    noteworthy as a high overall task count.

proxmox-datacenter-manager-ui (0.3.1) trixie; urgency=medium

  * status icons: replace background color with text-shadow to avoid blocky
    artefact.

  * dashboard: rework default refresh and max-age interval values. Lower the
    default max-age to 30s to ensure somewhat recent data when a user keeps
    the dashboard open for a long time but update even more frequently to get
    any newer data that was pulled in by the periodic update task of the
    backend or due to another user triggering an update.

  * dashboard: use high max-age for initial load to avoid a potentially costly
    load from the remotes which then delays the first render. To still get
    current data as per the users setting trigger a normal reload directly
    after this initial high-max-age load.

  * dashboard: make reload button do a reload with low max-age of 3s, making
    it act much like a force-reload button.

  * dashboard: default to showing tasks from last 2 days (48h).

  * search box: close if user navigated to an entry.

  * expose translations again now that we got full fledged integration into
    the common proxmox-i18n translation repository.

    tab to be able to see available node package updates.

  * sdn: add EVPN overview panel and view for showing EVPN zones.

  * sdn: add view for showing ip VRFs (virtual routing functions). It shows a
    list of VNets who would have the Route Target of the IP-VRF in their EVPN
    route target.

  * sdn: add component for creating EVPN vNets.

  * dashboard: open search with a matching query when clicking various panels
    or rows, like remotes or resources.

  * dashboard: add task summaries to provide an overview for all tasks and
    their status.

    exposes, like pressure stall information (PSI).

  * VM, container and nodes: add time-frame selector for RRD metric views.

  * remotes: node url list: add placeholder and clear trigger.

  * PVE remote wizard improvements:
    + probe hosts to verify fingerprint settings, ensuring that either the
      provided ones match or ask the user on-demand for a trust on first use
      like confirmation similar to how host keys for SSH connections get
      confirmed.
    + avoid duplicated entry for the initial provided host in the remote
      config.
    + rename 'realm' variable to 'info' to avoid confusion, as this is not
      just for the authentication realm.
    + improve various texts.
    + connect: reset later pages when form changes, as they need to be
      revisited in this case.

  * improve translatable strings.

  * main menu: make remote loading icon prettier.

    remote resource to handle the relatively frequent case where the admins
    end devices needs to use a different URL compared to the PDM to talk to a
    remote, for example because the PDM uses a tunnel to talk directly to the
    remote nodes whereas the admin needs to connect over a central reverse
    proxy or simply needs to use another domain name or IP address.

  * configuration: replace Other tab with WebAuthn, as that was the sole
    panel there anyway.

  * remotes: add task view tab to global remote panel

  * show running tasks from remotes in the 'running tasks' list
