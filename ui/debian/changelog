    remote resource to handle the relatively frequent case where the admins
    end devices needs to use a different URL compared to the PDM to talk to a

    remote nodes whereas the admin needs to connect over a central reverse
    proxy or simply needs to use another domain name or IP address.

    panel there anyway.
